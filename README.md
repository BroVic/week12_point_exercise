# Week 12 structs exercise #

## Exercise 1 ##

* The starter code contains the point struct from last week, 
  and an implementation of operator==

* Tasks:
   
  - Implement operator!=

  - Implement (binary) operator+ and operator-
 
  - Implement operator+= and operator-=.
    What type should these functions return? 
    (Think: do as the ints do!)

  - (Harder) Implement operator<< for output streams

  - Test all your operator overloads in your main() routine
